# claude_chat
A CLI tool to chat with Claude Sonnet in the CLI

I'm a beginner and got sick of leaving the terminal to ask questions in my browser.  I honestly know little to noting about Rust. I only used Rust because I kept running into dead ends with python and I just wanted something simple  There are better solutions but I havnt had any luck getting them to work.  So if you see room for improvements, just let me know.  I'm including The whold project directory.  But the "claude" file is all you need.  

Move the "claude" file to usr/local/bin (or any other folder in your $PATH)
```mv path/to/claude usr/local/bin```

and make sure to use
```sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/claude```

# Editing and compiling
As long as you have rust installed, you should be able to edit the main.rs and just type ```cargo run```. If that doesn't work then IDK what to tell you, I'm unfortunately not a rust developer... yet
